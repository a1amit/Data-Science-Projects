# Data Science Projects

This repository contains data science projects focusing on various topics, including Pandas, Linear Regression, Regex, and Classification. Each project is organized within its own folder, and detailed instructions can be found in the respective "instructions" folder of each project.

## Projects

- **Pandas**: This project explores the powerful Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis. To get started, navigate to the [Pandas project folder](/Pandas/) and refer to the instructions provided in the [instructions folder](Data-Science-Projects/Pandas/Instructions/).

- **Linear Regression**: In this project, you will delve into linear regression, a fundamental statistical method for modeling the relationship between variables. To begin, access the [Linear Regression project folder](Data-Science-Projects/Linear%20Regression/) and review the instructions available in the [instructions folder](Data-Science-Projects/Linear%20Regression/Instructions/).

- **Regex**: The Regex project focuses on regular expressions, which are essential tools for pattern matching and text processing. To explore this topic, proceed to the [Regex project folder](Data-Science-Projects/Regex/) and consult the instructions located in the [instructions folder](Data-Science-Projects/Regex/Instructions/).

- **Classification**: This project is dedicated to classification, a fundamental task in machine learning that involves assigning predefined categories to data instances. To dive into classification techniques, navigate to the [Classification project folder](Data-Science-Projects/Classification/) and find the instructions in the [instructions folder](Data-Science-Projects/Classification/Instructions/).

Feel free to explore and leverage these projects to enhance your understanding of data science concepts. Each project folder contains code examples, datasets, and additional resources to help you grasp the topic at hand.
